"Custom filter lists"
## DNS Block & Allow lists for AdGuard Home

- This repository is made to host some custom filter lists for AdGuard, to block and allow certain DNS requests.
- If you find any of the lists useful for yourself, please add them accordingly to your setup.

#### I take no responsibility if any of the lists break any sites you use! Only use lists according to your needs!

## Usecase
#### Simply:

- Adguard is basically a DNS server, that blocks any and all access to domains you don't want to "reach" online.
- In Adguard there's filterlists that hold huge variety of different domains that are either blocked or allowed.
- When you block a domain, it blocks access to that specific site, for the entire "network" not just the client like PC.
- You can also allow specific domains you trust and want limited or unlimited access to.

## How to use 
 Copy and paste any of the following lines into your DNS blocklists by clicking "Add blocklist"
